# What is Oscar Pooler

This is a simple way to manage the organisation of a car pool: every
one says if he comes, if he comes with other friends and if he has a
car.

# Why ?

Because I have this kind of problem, synchronisation _via_ emails
quickly gets annoying and google docs didn't do the trick for me. And
above all, it was a reasonably good reason to hack a little django
app.
